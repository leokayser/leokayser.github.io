  title={Computational Complexity of Polynomial Subalgebras}, 
  abstract={The computational complexity of polynomial ideals and Gröbner bases has been studied since the 1980s.
    In recent years the related notions of polynomial subalgebras and SAGBI bases have gained more and more attention in computational algebra, with a view towards effective algorithms.
    We investigate the computational complexity of the subalgebra membership problem and degree bounds.
    In particular, we place these problems in the complexity class <b>EXPSPACE</b> and prove <b>PSPACE</b>-completeness for homogeneous algebras.
    We highlight parallels and differences compared to the settings of ideals and also look at important classes of polynomials such as monomial algebras.},

  title={Logarithmic Discriminants of Hyperplane Arrangements}, 
  abstract={A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions.
    The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement.
    We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.},

  title={Mukai lifting of self-dual points in ℙ⁶}, 
  abstract={A set of 2n points in ℙ^{n-1} is self-dual if it is invariant under the Gale transform.
  Motivated by Mukai's work on canonical curves, Petrakiev showed that a general self-dual set of 14 points in ℙ⁶ arises as the intersection of the Grassmannian Gr(2,6) in its Plücker embedding in ℙ¹⁴ with a linear space of dimension 6.
  In this paper we focus on the inverse problem of recovering such a linear space associated to a general self-dual set of points.
  We use numerical homotopy continuation to approach the problem and implement an algorithm in Julia to solve it. Along the way we also implement the forward problem of slicing Grassmannians and use it to experimentally study the real solutions to this problem.},

  title={Hilbert Functions of Chopped Ideals}, 
  abstract={A chopped ideal is obtained from a homogeneous ideal by considering only the generators of a fixed degree.
    We investigate cases in which the chopped ideal defines the same finite set of points as the original one-dimensional ideal.
    The complexity of computing these points from the chopped ideal is governed by the Hilbert function and regularity.
    We conjecture values for these invariants and prove them in many cases.
    We show that our conjecture is of practical relevance for symmetric tensor decomposition.},

  title={[Re] On Explainability of Graph Neural Networks via Subgraph Explorations}, 
  abstract={Yuan et al. claim their proposed method SubgraphX achieves (i) higher fidelity in explaining models for graph- and node classification tasks compared to other explanation techniques, namely GNNExplainer.
    Additionally, (ii) the computational effort of SubgraphX is at a 'reasonable level', which is not further specified by the original authors. We define this as at most ten times slower than GNNExplainer. 
    We reimplemented the proposed algorithm in PyTorch. Then, we replicated the experiments performed by the authors on a smaller scale due to resource constraints.
    Additionally, we checked the performance on a new dataset and investigated the influence of hyperparameters. Lastly, we improved SubgraphX using greedy initialization and utilizing fidelity as a score function.},

  title={Gröbner Bases and Their Complexity},
  author={Leonie Kayser},
  abstract={Polynomial equations and their solutions play a ubiquitous role both for theoretical and practical applications.
    A closely related problem is that of ideal membership, i.e. deciding whether a polynomial is a linear combination of other polynomials.
    Gröbner bases provide a well-developed machinery to deal with these problems symbolically as a part of computer algebra systems.
    In this thesis we give an introduction to the theory of Gröbner bases with a view towards computational complexity.
    In particular, we discuss algorithmic aspects and upper bounds depending on the classes of polynomials considered.
    Furthermore, lower bounds on the size and computational complexity of Gröbner bases and related problems are presented.
    While often useful in practice, the worst-case complexity of Gröbner bases is located in <b>EXPSPACE</b>.},
