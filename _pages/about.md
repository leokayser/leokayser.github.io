Hi, I'm Leonie (she/her), PhD candidate in mathematics at [MPI MiS](https://www.mis.mpg.de/), Leipzig. I'm a member of the [Nonlinear Algebra Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nonlinear-algebra), more specifically the [Numerical Algebraic Geometry Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/numerical-algebraic-geometry). My advisor is [Simon Telen](https://sites.google.com/view/simontelen/) and my mentor is [Fulvio Gesmundo](https://fulges.github.io/). I am interested in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry with a view towards computation and applications.

I studied both mathematics and computer science at Leibniz University Hannover from 2016 to 2022. I wrote my master's theses on <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/The_Waring_problem_for_polynomials.pdf" target="_blank">The Waring problem for polynomials</a> under [Matthias Schütt](https://www.iag.uni-hannover.de/en/schuett/) and on <a href="/assets/pdf/papers/Groebner_Bases_and_Their_Complexity.pdf" target="_blank">Gröbner Bases and Their Complexity</a> under [Heribert Vollmer](https://www.thi.uni-hannover.de/en/vollmer/).
