description: The projective line minus the point at infinity is the affine line. But what if I steal a different, maybe even non-rational point? Let's work it out!

When being introduced to classical projective geometry over a field $k$, we learn that $\PP^n(k) = \AA^n(k) \cup H_\infty$, where $H_\infty \cong \PP^{n-1}(k)$ is a (preferred) hyperplane at infinity. In particular $\PP^1(k) = \AA^1(k) \cup \infty$. [The same is true](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1854029/is-the-projective-line-minus-one-point-always-isomorphic-to-the-affine-space) if you remove any other point from $\PP^1(k)$, since $\operatorname{PGL}(2,k)$ acts transitively on $\PP^1(k)$. Here "$\PP^1(k) \setminus p \cong \AA^1(k)$" really only makes sense as algebraic varieties (if $k$ is algebraically closed) or as manifolds (if $k=\RR$ or $K=\CC$).

But what happens if I remove a closed point from the $k$-scheme $\PP^1_k$ which is not a $k$-valued point? This question came up when typing up my answer to [this SE question](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4974966/1213739), where I wanted to conclude $\PP^1_k \setminus p \cong \AA^1_k$, which works if $k$ is algebraically closed. In this post we will develop a concise description of $X \coloneqq \PP^1_k \setminus p$, where $p$ is an *arbitrary* closed point.

You're invited to ponder about this before reading my solution below. Before spoiling the result, as an example consider the real projective line without a (specific) complex point: 

$$p = V(t^2+1) \in \AA_\RR^1 \subseteq \PP_\RR^1.$$

Then $\PP_\RR^1\setminus p$ is isomorphic to the real plane curve $V(x^2+y^2 - x) \subseteq \AA_\RR^2$. This curve has divisor class group $\ZZ/2\ZZ$ and hence is not isomorphic to $\AA_\RR^1$.

## Affineness

To get started, let $S \coloneqq k[t_0,t_1]$ be the homogeneous coordinate ring of $\PP_k^1 = \Proj S$, then every homogeneous element $f \in S_d$ ($d\geq 1$) give rise to a distinguished open subset

$$D_+(f) = \PP^1_k \setminus V(f) = \Set{\pp \in \Proj S \,|\, f(\pp) \neq 0 }, \qquad \OO_{\PP^1_k}(D_+(f)) = (S_f)_0 = \Set{ \frac{g}{f^j} \in S_f \,|\, g \in S_{jd}}.$$

Now let $p \in \PP_k^1 $ be a closed point, it thus corresponds to a homogeneous prime ideal of dimension $1$. Since $S = k[t_0,t_1]$ is a unique factorization domain and $p$ has codimension $2-1=1$, it is generated by a single homogeneous polynomial $f \in S_d$. This already establishes that $X = D_+(f)$ is an affine variety; it is a smooth irreducible curve as an open subset of $\PP_k^1$.

## The class group

Next let's understand the class group of $X$. Since $p \in \PP_k^1$ is a divisor, we have an exact sequence [Hartshorne, Prop. II.6.5]

$$
\ZZ\,p \longrightarrow \Cl(\PP_k^1) \longrightarrow \Cl(X) \longrightarrow 0.
$$

The divisor $[p]$ has degree $[\kappa(p) : k] = d$, so it generates a subgroup of index $d$ in $\ZZ = \Cl(\PP_1^k)$. This shows that $\Cl(X) \cong \ZZ/d\ZZ$; in particular $X$ is isomorphic to $\AA_k^1$ if and only if $p$ is a $k$-valued point!

## Defining equations

To obtain defining equations of $X$ in a suitable embedding into affine space, we need to understand the ring $A \coloneqq (S_f)\_0$. Every polynomial $g/f^j$ is a sum of fractions of the type $t_0^{a_0}t_1^{a_1} / f^j$, hence degree $d$ monomials divided by $f$ generate $A$ as a $k$-algebra. This is to say, $A$ is a quotient of the $d$-th Veronese subring $S_{d \bullet} \subseteq S = k[t_0,t_1]$ [Vakil, Section 7.4.4]. This is the homogeneous coordinate ring of the [rational normal curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_normal_curve) $C_d \subseteq \PP^d_k$. Its homogeneous vanishing ideal in $R = k[x_0,\dots,x_d]$ is minimally generated by the $\binom{d}{2}$ quadrics

$$ I(C_d) = \langle  \operatorname{minors}_2 \begin{bmatrix} x_0 & x_1 & \cdots & x_{d-1} \\ x_1 & x_2 & \cdots & x_d \end{bmatrix} \rangle _R $$

Our irreducible polynomial $f = \sum_{i=0}^d c_i t\_0^{d-i} t\_1^{i} \in S_d$ corresponds to the linear form $c_0 x_0 + \dots + c_d x_d$ under the isomorphism

$$R/I(C_d) \overset{\sim}{\rightarrow} S_{d \bullet}, \qquad x_i \mapsto t_0^{d-i} t_1^i .$$

Let's return to  $(S_f)\_0$, this is a quotient of $R$, where not only the relations $I(C_d)$ hold, but also the relation $\sum_i c_i x_i = 1$, corresponding to the identity $f/f = 1$. I claim that this is in fact the *only* additional relation, thus

$$X = \Spec R/\langle I(C_d), c_0 x_0 + \dots + c_d x_d - 1\rangle. $$

To see this, introduce an additional variable $z$ and consider the inclusion $C_d \subseteq \PP_k^d \hookrightarrow \PP_k^{d+1}$ with ideal $I(C_d), z$. Rational normal curves are Arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM)
